# Why should we do this?

GNOME Evolution has the ability to print calendars, but it doesn't help us understand the temporal dimension of things. It looks more like a list of tasks. 

MacOS iCalendar has the ability to print calendars, and they look rather pretty. It is, however, something of a pain to synchronize my calendar over there and then go through the UI to export the PDF. Perhaps this could be tackled with `osascript`; it appears that `osascript` could work through `ssh`... Something to think about in any case.
